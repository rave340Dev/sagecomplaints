Final warning
---

I have been with sage for almost a year and a half now. I have __never__ had any incidents, nor done anything that warrants a verbal warning, let alone jumping straight to a final warning. In fact my experience has been quite the opposite. Every supervisor/lead/etc has pushed/fought for me to be brought up to a lead, starting with the previous Server lead, Daniel Means, within a couple months of my hiring. I have always worked to the best of my abilities, trying to improve this company, whilst keeping a positive work environment. If there has ever been a need for someone to jump in and learn/help out in an area I have always been ready and willing to do so.

When I made this comment initially I had added a gif reflexively, not with the intention of ignoring Tammis statement asking for there to be no more gifs/memes in the chat. The instant it was pointed out to me that I had done so I immediately removed said gif and apologized for doing so. This shouldve ended right there, there is absolutely zero justification for this to have gone so far against an employee with an unimpeachable record. There was nothing insulting, rude, disrespectful, let alone insubordinate with my message. Ignoring that, with my record at this company I cant even get the respect to at least get a verbal warning instead of jumping straight to a final warning over such a small issue? That's absolutely unacceptable for any company that claims to 
___"hire people who are passionate about our mission and who are open, positive, and will hold themselves accountable for achieving business results. We are committed to cultivating a work environment that is based on trust, mutual respect and fun."___

This is an issue I have been complaining about practically since I have started with this company, especially the last few months. Not only does it degrade the lifespan of the equipment, its wholly unhealthy to be around. There are quite a few individuals, including myself, that have consistently come in to work feeling perfectly fine, but quickly after entering the floor start to become sick, and as soon as they leave the floor begin to feel immediate relief. Bringing this up continually achieves nothing as it continues to be swept under the rug as a non-issue. Where is the respect for the employees health? How is it respectful for a plant manager to treat their staff like children and fabricate a reason to remove gifs/memes that anyone with the smallest inkling of IT knowledge will know is wholly false, instead of just coming out and saying that there is to be no more gifs/memes in chat? Not only was her comment treating us like children, it also diminishes our knowledge.

How respectful is it to allow one of your staff to scream and berate another shifts staff, over an issue that was the fault of none of the individuals no less? How respectful is it to constantly ignore safety concerns brought up by the staff, one of which would have prevented the occurance that caused the screaming. We can't get the plant manager to replace 2 measly outlets that have been a safety concern for over a year, even after bringing the issue, with documentation, to hr and we still cant get a couple dollars spent to give us peace of mind that we wont one day accidentally electrocute ourselves because of a loose outlet?

Even if you went hospital grade to get the highest quality outlets it is still inexcusably cheap to replace.

Not to mention to prevent network outages because the networking equipment is hooked up the same outlet instead of being in a seperate room like any respectable/knowledgable IT company would do.
